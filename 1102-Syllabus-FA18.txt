#### World History 2, 1102, with Jack Norton ####

_“You can best serve civilization by being against what usually passes for it.”_ Wendell Berry

_“Learning is always rebellion . . . Every bit of new truth discovered is revolutionary to what was believed before.”_ Margaret Lee Runbeck_ 

**Welcome** to World History. Our course will focus on one theme: poverty. 

**Welcome** to World History. We will be doing what is called digital history for our course. That is, we will study the past by using computing technologies (mostly webpages) to create digital projects. I assume you are able to operate a computer (turn it on, open a browser) and no more.

There are no prerequisites for this course, and you do *not* need any specialized knowledge. The class will be taught in English, with occasional cheesy jokes and mild vulgarities in Spanish.  

I want you to learn about the past, learn new skills about how to analyze and present about the past, and learn new ways of _how_ to learn (called metacongition). The learning goals (or outcomes, fit in these three groups. The goals for this course are below. I may sometimes call these learning outcomes, or the stuff I want you to be able to do by the end of this course.  

1.  Demonstrate a broad understanding of World History from pre-History through the early modern era (thirteenth through seventeenth centuries CE).

*   Make use of historical thinking.

*   Analyze historical sources, distinguishing primary from secondary sources; 

*   Communicate effectively using historical evidence and methods.

*   Analyze and understand the diversity of peoples within their distinctive historical contexts.  


*   Develop strategies for advancing your learning skills, such as effective reading, writing, acquiring new digital skills and critically analyzing historical sources.
    
*   Demonstrate an understanding of the ethics of acquiring, using, and presenting historical sources, as articulated by both professional organizations and historical subjects.

**Office Hours:** Monday and Wednesday Noon to 1 pm, Tuesday and Thursday, 10:30 am to noon. Also, by appointment: we can always set up a time to chat 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. by phone or video (skype, google, facetime).

**Course Policies**

**Attendance- Attendance is required!** You need to check in with our course regularly throughout the week. In my face-to-face courses I take attendance. For online courses, I expect you to read, post, and otherwise contribute to D2L at least five times a week. The course grades are set up to reward students who work regularly on our course up and penalize students who do not. For example, there are no make-up quizzes or discussions, no exceptions.

As an incentive for regular attendance, online-only students who turn in all their assignments on-time, and miss no discussions or quizzes, will earn a bonus of 4% on their final grade. the same bonus is available to face-to-face students who have no absences for the entire semester.  

**Grades**

| Grades Items                                  | Weighted Percentage |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Module Assignments                            | 49%                 |
| Exhibits                                      | 10%                 |
| Discussions(Online)                           | 22%                 |
| Quizzes                                       | 16%                 |
| Class Citizenship                             | 2%                  |

BONUS: Bug hunt- If you find an error in any course materials that can affect learning (a broken link, an ommitted word that changes the meaning of an assignment), please email me with "bug hunt" in the subject line. I'll give you an extra 1% on your next assignment. Reporting minor bugs, such as a misformatted web page or non-learning related spelling error, earn my thanks.

**E-Learning- What you need to know**– *You must use your student email for all emails to me*. Despite the digital methods of this history course, this is NOT a learn at your own pace course. The due dates for assignments are hard (Fridays at 8 p.m.) and discussion boards close at the same time (for online classes). Online-only education allows you to learn without coming to campus, but it is in fact a more demanding form of college. Online-only students need to be a reasonably skilled keyboardists and comfortable with computer technology. If the words upload, download, convert to pdf, or "As Jon mentioned in his post on religion. . . " are foreign to you, an online-only course might not be the course for you. I want you to succeed, which is why I want you to be honest with yourself about your abilities. Face-to-face courses let me offer real-time support and are generally easier (or so report my students). 

For all my students, to succeed in this course you will need to:

-   Turn on a computer and open a browser. 

-   Watch streaming video from pgs.org and other websites.

-   Navigate the Normandale Library website successfully.

-   Spell check everything.
    
For online only, you need to be able to:

-  Download and install software on your computer.

-  Recognize that written communication requires more careful word choice than oral communication. For example, sarcastic comments don’t work because you can’t read sarcasm, only hear it. 

If you need technology help, you may call our IT help desk at 952-358-8181.  Even better, ask them a question on Normandale's “[*Ask Us*](http://normandale.custhelp.com/app/home)” page, which will help track your request.  

**Basic Needs Statement** 
If you have difficulty affording groceries or  

**Late Work-** Assignments are due by the 8 p.m. on Friday for the week of the assignment listed in the course calendar. Assignments handed in late are penalized 15 points. Late work may be handed in until the D2L Assignment Submission Folder for late work closes, the penultimate week of class. *Quizzes, in-class responses, and discussions may not be made up.* Your lowest two quiz grades, discussion grades or in-class response grades are automatically dropped. 

**Reading and Writing-** This is a reading and writing-intensive course. You will read up to 75 pages a week and write at least 16 pages of typed, doubled-spaced pages of text (total, not all at once). Writing guidelines for each assignment will be discussed in course and included on the assignment.  

**All work** will be written in [plain text](http://www.monkeyjob.com/FAQ/What-Plain-Text-File.htm) in the [Markdown](<http://commonmark.org/help/>) syntax. When it comes to formatting your own writing, I assume you know how to turn on a computer, and open a web browser. Everything else I will teach you how to do with careful instructions and diligent follow-ups.

**Grading-** Written work, unless otherwise noted, will be graded according to a rubric (a grading chart,) which will be posted at the time of the assignment. If you are struggling with any assignments, please do not suffer in silence. Make an appointment with me so that we can address your questions. I succeed when you succeed.

#### Academic Standards ####

### Why are grades on D2L but most of the course material are on jacknorton.org? ###

The Federal Education Rights Privacy Act requires that all computer systems with access to private student data (like your grades) have  a secure login. I'm not willing to maintain this type of system, so we use D2L for those items related to grades. For everything else, having the course avaiable on the open web is a superior option. If you want to know more, please see me. The tl;dr is that the open web is better for access, accountability, and responsive teaching. 

**Changes?**
Changes will be announced on our course [website](http://jacknorton.org/courses/world-history-1102-fall-2018/).

![Image of Comic About Credibility]( http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/pyramid_honey.png)

I reserve the right to amend this syllabus to better facilitatestudents’ learning. Changes to the syllabus (if any) will be announced
in the news section and an ammended syllabus will be posted on the classwebsite.
