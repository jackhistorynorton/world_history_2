## Conversations II Assignment ##

**Due on Friday at 8 p.m. **

**Question this lesson seeks to answer: **How can we write about history for the general public in ways that are both accurate and interesting? 

**Learning objectives. By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:**

1. Locate a credible news story, pinterest pin, tweet or wordpress post about a contemporary (2018) issue about an **issue** you believe is rooted in industrialization. 

2. Locate a credible *primary source* that explains the importance of the **issue** that you've identified.  

3. Accept an account invitation to wordpress.  

4. Login to a wordpress account.  

5.Write a post on our wordpress blog entry explaining the history of the issue and why it matters.

**Background**

By now you've introduced yourself to three social media platforms, and you're familiarized yourself with the international nature of industrializaiton. As your video and readings/images made clear, industrialization took place at different times (early 19th century for some, late 19th or 20th century for othes), in different ways (monopolist driven, government driven, state-monopolist driven, individual driven) and in different places. As world historians, it's tough to talk about industrialization because that means so many different things to different peoples. Japanese women labored as factory workers, whereas in Britain and the U.S., men did more factory work.

**How to sign up for WordPress.**

1. Check your Normandale email. 

2. Accept the invitation to the wordpress blog History at Normandale.

**Write and tag your post.**

Your post should be fewer than 500 words, including all quotations and citations for any images.

You do not need to post images to earn an A, but you do need to post links to your contemporary source and your historical primary source.

A composition window, very similar to Microsoft Word, will pop up and let you write you post. To add a link to your text, highlight the text and hit command and K (Mac) and CRTL and K (Windows) to make that word a link. Or you can click on the “Insert/edit link” button.(1)

Your post should do the following things:

* Explain your your secondary and primary sources to a general audience. 
* Explain how your two sources relate to each other 
* Explain what issue the two sources raise for you. 
* Explain how historical industrialization helps us understand this contemporary issue. 

Style guide: Your post should be conversational, much like you'd talk to a friend and a coffee shop. You don't start conversations with “In this conversation I argue that . . .” or finish friendly chats with “In conclusion, points, a, b, and c all point to . . .” Nor do you speak in bullet points. You tell a story. See my example on the blog (all the way at the start of the blog) for conversational style.

Be sure to give your post a title.(2) 

Please tag your post (tagging is adding a keyword) on the left hand side. Please add "1101 online" or "1101 Face-to-face" as your tag.

**Publish your post.**

Once you've written, edited, titled, and tagged your post, click on "Publish" to add your post to the blog. 

Note: I use this blog for multiple classes, you'll see blog entries on industrialization from other students.

**Time to complete**

I expect it should take you about an hour to find two sources that work well together, another hour to figure out how to write an interesting post, and two hours to write, edit, and publish your post. 

**Don't miss!**

This is as close to traditional history paper as you get in this class. 500 words is about two pages, which is not easy to write well. Give yourself time. When students have succeeded on this assignment in the past is when they broke it into chunks and worked and though about it over an entire week. Students that dumped a couple of hastily found sources into a rambling "this is what I think about things on the internet" have struggled to earn decent grades. 

**Grading Criteria**

Student: 

1. Located a credible news story, pinterest pin, tweet or wordpress post about a contemporary (2018) issue about an **issue** related directly Industrialization. 

2. Located a credible *primary source* that explains the importance of the **issue** that you've identified. 

3. Accepted an account invitation to wordpress. 

4. Logged in to a wordpress account. 

5. Write and post a blog entry on how your issue relates to Industrialization. 

6. Blog post used standard English capitalization, punctuation and usage. 

7. Blog post demonstrates understanding of the historical topic covered. 

8. Blog post makes an attempt to relate a historical subject to contemporary life.
