# Final Exam Digital Exhibit (Exhibits 1, 2, and final) 

For your final three grades (Exhibits 1, 2, and the Final Exam) you will produce a digital exhibit. 

## Question this final exam seeks to address: 

Using the history and digital tools we've covered this semester, can your design a simple digital exhibit that demonstrates a thesis? 

## Background

We have covered a huge period in history, from approximately 1400 CE to 1914 CE. We have also used digital history tools--such as Voyant, Historical Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-- to ask different types of questions about the past than are possible using traditional books. Along the way, I've asked you to explore some basic concepts in history, such as how can a map tell a story, what can numbers tell us about the past, and what are the limits of social media in addressing history. 

Your final exam will take the form of a digital exhibit on Wordpress. 

Part of creating your final exam will involve creating an outline and bibliography of your sources. This outline and bibliography will be peer reviewed. The entire assignment looks like this. 

1. Exhibits Lesson 1 Assignment: Outline and bibliography for final exhibit. **Due December 7th, 8 p.m., post to the Exhibits Assignment 1 discussion.**
2. Exhibits Lesson 2 Assignment: Complete peer review (through D2L) for one other student. **Due December 14th, respond in the Exhibits Assignment 2 discussion. NOTE: This assignment is listed in the Discussion Section of D2L.**
3. Final Exam: Complete your Wordpress exhibit: **Due December 19th at 8 p.m. NOTE: This is a Wednesday, not our standard Friday due date.**

## Learning outcomes: at the end of this assignment you will be able to- 

1. Identify six sources (3 primary, 3 secondary) that address a common theme and pass the PISA test. 
1. Analyze how your chosen six sources support a thesis of your creation. 
1. Create a thesis that makes an argument for the importance of a historical idea, person, place, event, or object. 
1. Create a Knightlab timeline with three of your sources.
1. Include sources from each of the modules (time, images, maps, words, numbers, and social media) in your digital exhibit. 
1. Written an extended blog post on our course blog. 
1. Write descriptive text in complete sentences to explain why you've chosen your sources.

## Assignment requirements

You must complete the **history research** part of this assignment before you create your **outline and bibliography** and then build the **digital exhibit** part of the project. 

**Exhibits Assignment 1: History Research**

More important than anything else in this assignment is your proposed **thesis** for your exhibit. Finish this sentence: "this exhibits demonstrates that . . . ." If you  can finish this sentence, you have a thesis. 

To create a thesis, you need a theme, or a topic so you can look for **sources. **Here's what you need to create a thesis. 

1. Six historical sources (three [primary sources](https://www.uvic.ca/library/research/tips/primvsec/index.php), three secondary sources). 
  1. You must include one non-digital source (a physical book or historical object that you viewed in person)
1. A defined topic that relates all of your sources to one another. 
1. A period of time less than 100 years. Your thesis can connect sources that are up to 100 years apart. 
1. _Your sources must address these six modules: Time (a dated source), Images (a picture), Maps (a GIS map), Words (a voyant analysis of a text), Numbers (statistics about your topic), Social Media (a post about your topic), with one source for each module._
1. All of your sources must pass the PISA (publication, institution, sources, author) credibility test.
1. You do NOT need more than six sources to earn an "A," and more sources are not better. It's better to have six great sources rather and eight weak ones. 

**Outline and Bibliography **

Once you have six sources and a thesis, you can compose the outline for your digital exhibit. Your final exhibit (blog post) will have three sections: a thesis, background information, and supporting points. Your outline will need to look like this: 

1. Thesis 
1. Source 1 (full citation using the [Chicago Manual of Style](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html) or another format. Make your life easier and use a [citation machine](http://www.citationmachine.net/chicago/cite-a-book/manual) if you can.) 
1. Sources 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 with full citations.
1. Explain in three sentences why you think your sources support your thesis. This is the most important part of the assignment. You must show how your sources **support (not relate to) **your thesis.

Submit this part of the assignment to the discussion board by Friday at 8 p.m..
